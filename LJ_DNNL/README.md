### Enclave.config.xml

### Enclave.cpp
#### Includes
- "sgx_trts.h", which provides Intel SGX trusted runtime system services
- "Enclave_t.h", which is a header file generated by the Intel SGX SDK based on your enclave's EDL (Enclave Definition Language) file
#### extern "C" int printf(const char *fmt, ...)
- This is a redefinition of the standard C printf function for use inside the enclave. This function is declared with an extern "C" linkage specification to prevent C++ name mangling, as this function will be called from C code. This function takes a format string and a variable number of arguments, similar to the standard printf.
- Inside the printf function:
- A buffer buf of size 300 is created to store the output string.
- A va_list is initialized to handle the variable number of arguments.
- The vsnprintf function is called to format the output string according to the provided format string and arguments, storing the result in the buf buffer.
- va_end is called to clean up the va_list.
- The custom ocall_print_string function is called to send the formatted output string to the untrusted application outside the enclave for printing. Note that the actual printing is done outside the enclave since SGX enclaves cannot access I/O directly.
- The function returns 0.
