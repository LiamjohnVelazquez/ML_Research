## Files included

### Enclave.config.xml

### Enclave.cpp
#### Includes
- "sgx_trts.h", which provides Intel SGX trusted runtime system services
- "Enclave_t.h", which is a header file generated by the Intel SGX SDK based on your enclave's EDL (Enclave Definition Language) file
#### extern "C" int printf(const char *fmt, ...)
- This is a redefinition of the standard C printf function for use inside the enclave. This function is declared with an extern "C" linkage specification to prevent C++ name mangling, as this function will be called from C code. This function takes a format string and a variable number of arguments, similar to the standard printf.
- Inside the printf function:
- A buffer buf of size 300 is created to store the output string.
- A va_list is initialized to handle the variable number of arguments.
- The vsnprintf function is called to format the output string according to the provided format string and arguments, storing the result in the buf buffer.
- va_end is called to clean up the va_list.
- The custom ocall_print_string function is called to send the formatted output string to the untrusted application outside the enclave for printing. Note that the actual printing is done outside the enclave since SGX enclaves cannot access I/O directly.
- The function returns 0.


### Enclave.edl
#### .edl files used for protyping functions so they can be accessed by out other files

### Enclave.lds
##### The "Enclave.lds" file is a linker script for the enclave. Linker scripts are used to control the memory layout and symbol exports of the final compiled binary. In this case, the linker script is used to specify which symbols should be exported as global or local when building the enclave shared library (libenclave.so).
- global:: This section lists the global symbols that should be exported by the enclave shared library. These symbols are visible outside the enclave and can be used by the untrusted application or other enclaves.

- g_global_data_sim: A global variable for simulation mode.
- g_global_data: A global variable for the actual SGX enclave.
- enclave_entry: The entry point of the enclave. This is the function called when the enclave is first initialized.
- g_peak_heap_used: A global variable for tracking peak heap memory usage.
- g_peak_rsrv_mem_committed: A global variable for tracking peak reserved memory committed.
- local:: This section lists the local symbols that should not be exported by the enclave shared library. In this case, the wildcard * is used, which means all symbols not listed in the global section will be treated as local and not visible outside the enclave.
