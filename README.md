- This video does not cover psw installation, refer to github for that, useful for visual represenation


- Steps to run sample code in simulation mode
  - cd into desired sample code e.g. (/linux-sgx/linux/installer/bin/sgxsdk/SampleCode/[desired sample code]) 
  - create makefile " make SGX_MODE=[desired mode]"
    - e.g. SGX_MODE=SIM
  - cd into bin
  - ls to view "app"
  - "./app" to run code
  - In case sdk isnt working after restarting pc try setting up environment variables again by cd into "/linux-sgx/linux/installer/bin/" and using command "$ source /home/iar/linux-sgx/linux/installer/bin/sgxsdk/environment" replace this line with your specific path
  
source /home/iar/linux-sgx/linux/installer/bin/sgxsdk/environment

## Intel Deep Neural Network
[The project demonstrates Intel(R) Deep Neural Network Library (DNNL) functions inside Intel(R) SGX environment](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx/tree/master/SampleCode/SampleDNNL)
performed make next step is 
4. Install Intel(R) SGX DNNL library and header files.
   a. Copy Intel(R) SGX DNNL lib to the Intel(R) SGX SDK installation directory.
      $ cp "./sgx_dnnl/lib/libsgx_dnnl.a" "$(SGX_SDK)/lib64"
   b. Copy Intel(R) SGX DNNL header files to the Intel(R) SGX SDK header file directory.
      $ cp "./sgx_dnnl/include/*" "$(SGX_SDK)/include"
